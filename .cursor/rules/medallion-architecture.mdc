# Medallion Architecture Guidelines

This project implements the **Medallion Architecture** (also known as Bronze-Silver-Gold) for data processing in Databricks.

## Architecture Overview

The data flows through three distinct layers, each with specific purposes:

### ðŸ¥‰ Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
- **Purpose**: Faithful ingestion of raw data from Landing zone
- **Characteristics**: Minimal processing, maximum auditability
- **Notebook**: [002_-landing_to_bronze_automobile.ipynb](mdc:notebooks/002_-landing_to_bronze_automobile.ipynb)
- **Data**: Raw, unprocessed data with schema evolution support

### ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Layer (Cleaned Data)
- **Purpose**: Data cleaning, standardization, and enrichment
- **Characteristics**: Business-ready data with quality controls
- **Notebook**: [003_-bronze_to_silver_automobile.ipynb](mdc:notebooks/003_-bronze_to_silver_automobile.ipynb)
- **Data**: Cleaned, validated, and integrated data

### ðŸ¥‡ Gold Layer (Business Data)
- **Purpose**: Aggregations, metrics, and business-specific datasets
- **Characteristics**: Optimized for consumption and analytics
- **Notebook**: [004_-silver_to_gold_automobile.ipynb](mdc:notebooks/004_-silver_to_gold_automobile.ipynb)
- **Data**: Curated datasets for dashboards and reports

## Data Flow Pattern

```
Landing â†’ Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold
```

## Key Principles

1. **Idempotency**: Notebooks should be re-runnable without side effects
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a distinct responsibility
3. **Data Lineage**: Clear traceability from source to consumption
4. **Schema Evolution**: Support for changing data structures
5. **Quality Gates**: Data validation at each layer transition

## Implementation Notes

- Use Delta Tables for persistence at each layer
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow naming conventions: `{layer}_{domain}_{purpose}`
- Parameterize operations for flexibility
- Use Spark SQL and PySpark for transformations
